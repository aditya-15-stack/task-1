## üìÅ Dataset Overview

**File:** `RESTAURANT SALES DATA.xlsx`

**Columns:**
- `Order ID` ‚Äì Unique order identifier
- `Customer ID` ‚Äì Unique customer identifier
- `Category` ‚Äì Item category (e.g., Starters, Main Dishes)
- `Item` ‚Äì Specific item ordered
- `Price` ‚Äì Item price
- `Quantity` ‚Äì Number of items ordered
- `Order Total` ‚Äì Total cost (Price √ó Quantity)
- `Order Date` ‚Äì Date of order
- `Payment Method` ‚Äì e.g., Credit Card, Cash

üîé A reference table (Columns K:M) contains `Category`, `Item`, and `Price` for validation.


## üßπ Data Cleaning Steps

### 1. Filling Missing `Item` Values
- **Issue:** Some rows had missing items.
- **Fix:** Matched `Category` and `Price` with the reference table to find the correct item.
- **Formula Used:**
  ```excel
  =IF(D2<>"", D2, IFERROR(INDEX($L$2:$L$21, MATCH(1, ($K$2:$K$21=C2)*($M$2:$M$21=E2), 0)), "Unknown_" & C2))
  ```
- Items not found in the reference table were labeled like `Unknown_Desserts`.

### 2. Filling Missing `Payment Method`
- **Issue:** Some payment methods were blank.
- **Fix:** Replaced with `"Credit Card"` (most common value).
- **Formula Used:**
  ```excel
  =IF(I2<>"", I2, "Credit Card")
  ```

### 3. Removing Nulls in Critical Columns
- **Issue:** Some rows had missing `Order ID` or `Category`.
- **Fix:** Removed those rows as they are essential for analysis.

### 4. Calculating Missing `Price`, `Quantity`, or `Order Total`
- **Issue:** Some rows had one of the three values missing.
- **Fix:** Used the relationship:  
  `Order Total = Price √ó Quantity` to calculate the missing value.
- **Formula Used:**
  ```excel
          =E2*F2

### 5. Verifying and Correcting `Order Total`
- **Issue:** Some totals didn‚Äôt match Price √ó Quantity.
- **Fix:** Recalculated and corrected them.
- **Check Formula:**
  ```excel
  =IF(G2=E2*F2, "Valid", "Error")
  ```

### 6. Fixing `Order Date` Format
- **Issue:** Dates were in inconsistent formats.
- **Fix:** Standardized all to `MM/DD/YYYY`.
- **Formula Used:**
  ```excel
  =TEXT(H2, "mm/dd/yyyy")
  ```
